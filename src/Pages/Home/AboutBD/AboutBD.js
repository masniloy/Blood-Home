                        <p className=" text-justify">Though Bangladesh has more than 166 million people, there are very few safe blood banks. Without divisional towns, there is hardly any blood bank. But a huge amount of blood is needed for treatment purposes. A good number of accidents take place every day where blood needs essentially. <br /><br />

                            As a result, people fall into real trouble managing blood. But there are many blood donors who are interested in donating blood but donâ€™t know who needs blood. That's why I developed a web application "BLOOD HOME" which is bridge the gap between blood donors and those in need of blood transfusions. BLOOD HOME provides a user-friendly and efficient system for connecting donors with patients, ensuring a timely and reliable supply of blood.</p>
